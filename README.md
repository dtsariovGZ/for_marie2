# Google Ads Research

## Types of campaigns
**1. Performance Max Campaigns**
- Access all Google Ads channels in one campaign with Google AI optimization.
- Benefits: simple setup, AI-driven budget and bid optimization, new customer discovery, and detailed insights.
- Best for: sales, leads, and **local promotions**.
- Less control over placements, heavy reliance on Google AI, limited transparency on exactly where ads show, requires high-quality creative assets to perform well.

**2. Search Campaigns**
- Text ads shown in Google search results.
- Benefits: highly targeted, easy to set up, ideal for capturing intent-driven users.
- Best for: driving sales, leads, and **website traffic**.
- Limited reach (only works when users search), competitive keywords can be costly, performance depends on keyword research and ad copy quality.

- Probably the best for real estate as people tend to search for "homes for sale near me"
- We already have websites
- bidding wars on popular keywords

**3. Display Campaigns**
- Visual ads on websites, apps, and Google properties (like YouTube).
- Benefits: expand reach beyond search, build brand awareness, retarget past visitors.
- Best for: awareness, consideration, and remarketing.
- Lower intent than search (users may not be ready to buy), ad fatigue if creative isn’t refreshed, potential for wasted spend if targeting is too broad.

**4. Video Campaigns**
- Video ads across YouTube and partner sites.
- Benefits: increase awareness, drive conversions, expand reach, tell stories with sequences.
- Types include: conversions, reach, views, and ad sequences.
- Requires video production (higher cost/effort), some users skip ads, measuring direct ROI can be harder compared to search.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Your campaign choice should align with your goals—whether that’s finding new customers, boosting sales, building awareness, or promoting an app. Google AI increasingly supports optimization across all campaign types to maximize ROI.

- **Performance Max** = broad reach, less control.
- **Search** = high intent, limited reach.
- **Display** = wide reach, lower intent.
- **Video** = strong awareness, harder ROI tracking.

## Budget variations
The "average daily, daily limit, monthly limit":
- set avg amount per day
- set max amount per day (usually 2 * avg) for daily variations
- monthly limit for even more variations over a month while keeping monthly bills consistent

other budget variations:
- **Shared Budget:** Allocate one budget across multiple campaigns.
- **Campaign Total Budget (Video only):** Fixed amount for the whole campaign—never exceeded.
these may be irrelevant for us as we don't already have a campaign...

### Daily costs:
***Served Cost***: total value of all clicks/impressions the campaign gets. Can exceed limits temporarily.
1. **Understand true demand:**
    - Served cost shows the _real value_ of all clicks/impressions your campaign could have generated without Google’s billing cap.
    - Example: If served = $23 but billed = $20, it means your ads were attractive enough to generate $23 worth of demand.
2. **Spot missed opportunities:**
    - If served cost is often much higher than billed cost, it suggests your **budget is too low** and you might be missing conversions.
    - This can help you decide whether to **raise your daily budget** to capture more traffic.
3. **Campaign health check:**
    - A big gap between served and billed shows Google is restricting delivery because of your budget.
    - A small/no gap means your budget is adequate for current demand.
- You **never pay** the difference, so it’s not your _real cost_.
- Can be confusing if you don’t understand the difference → looks like you’re overspending when you’re not.
***Billed cost***: The actual amount you pay. Always capped at spending limits

## Overall reddit
Google Ads for real estate **can be very effective** when:
- You control the landing page.
- Conversion tracking is in place.
- The campaign is well-optimized with realistic expectations of cost-per-lead.
⚠️ But many warn that without proper setup, it becomes **expensive, inefficient, and hard to prove ROI.**

### Utilize negative keywords
implement negative keywords to avoid wasting ad budget on users who aren't part of the target audience. idk about examples, maybe things like luxury, 

Google Ads allows for precise audience segmentation, which allows you to surface your ad to users based on their location, demographics, and online behavior.
- idk how much control we would have over this. Very nice though
Apparently regular monitoring is very recommended.

average pay per click in 2024 in Canada: $1.66
source: https://firstrank.ca/how-much-does-google-ads-cost/
according to the same source, the price per click in Canada in the real estate industry is $0.89
To decrease price further, we can try and increase the "quality score" of the add.
- Clickthrough rate
- quality and relevance of landing page
- quality and relevance of ad text
- relevance of the keyword to ad group
- how well ads have performed on our account in the past

***Bid*** is the maximum amount we would be willing to pay for a click
On the other hand, google search ads are the most expensive way to show ads alongside app ads. Hence the price per click could be a bit higher.

Another US source says the average cost per click (CPC) is $4.51 https://www.webfx.com/blog/ppc/much-cost-advertise-google-adwords/
- Keywords with location, urgency, or pricing intent—like “near me”, “emergency”, or “cost”—consistently drive higher CPCs across nearly every industry.
- this source says it costs around 5.38 per click

### Rough analysis
**Recommended Starting Budget:** $4,500-6,300/month for all 6 locations, expecting 210-300 leads monthly at $75-85 per lead.

The estimate considers several important factors specific to real estate leasing:

1. **Industry-Specific Metrics:** Real estate enjoys one of the lowest CPC rates at $1.55 [2025 Real Estate Marketing Metrics & Benchmarks by Promodo | Promodo.com](https://www.promodo.com/blog/real-estate-benchmarks-2024), but multifamily has an average cost per lead of $100.48 [Multifamily Google Ads Data Benchmarks | RentVision](https://www.rentvision.com/blog/multifamily-google-ads-data), which is higher due to longer lease cycles.
2. **Leasing vs. Sales:** During lease-up periods, you should spend 2.5x to 3x higher on ads daily because of higher vacancy [How much do multifamily PPC ads cost in 2025?](https://www.rentvision.com/blog/multifamily-ppc-digital-ads-costs) to fill units quickly and avoid lost revenue.
3. **Performance Expectations:** Real estate has a CTR of 9.09% which is above average, but conversion rates have decreased to 7.04% [2025 Real Estate Marketing Metrics & Benchmarks by Promodo | Promodo.com](https://www.promodo.com/blog/real-estate-benchmarks-2024) recently.

A key success that we might be missing is proper conversion tracking.
While the average cost per click is low, the cost per lead can be in the $75-95 range.
